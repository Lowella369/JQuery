# JQuery
#Contains all JQuery Lab exercise 

#Contos Web Developer Conference: 
1. Finding elements using JQuery 
2. For module two, you will enhance the interface for your review widget. The updated interface must meet the following goals
Provide a configurable number of circles for the user to click on. This can be accomplished by adding a custom attribute to the outer div element that contains the circles.
Allow the number of circles to be updated by a textbox. This is to simulate an administration widget; we will not be adding any form of security to the widget.
The existing functionality of hovering and selection must still work.
The starting ratings widget will have 5 circles.
3 For module three, you'll add the final feature to your rating widget: the ability to send the rating to a service.
The service has already been created. The service will act as a simple echo service, taking the rating you submit inside a JSON object, and then sending back a JSON containing a message. The structure of the expected JSON object, and the JSON object the service will return, are documented below.
